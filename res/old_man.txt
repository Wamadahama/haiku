The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in
 the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four
days now without taking a fish. In the first forty da
ys a boy had been with him. But after forty days
without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that
 the old man was now defi
nitely and finally salao,
which  is  the  worst  form  of  unlucky,  and  the  boy
had  gone  at  their  orders
  in  another  boat  which
caught three good fish the first
week. It made the boy sad to see th
e old man come in each day with
his  skiff  empty  and  he  always  went  down  to  help  him  carry  either  the  coiled  lines  or  the  gaff  and
harpoon  and  the  sail  that  was  furled  around  the  ma
st.  The  sail  was  patched  with  flour  sacks  and,
furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.
The  old  man  was  thin  and  gaunt  with  deep  wrinkles  in  the  back  of  his  neck.  The  brown
blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun br
ings from its [9] reflection on the tropic sea were
on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides
of his face and his hands had the deep-creased
scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none
 of these scars were fres
h. They were as old as
erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and
they were the same colo
r as the sea and were
cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed
the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. “I
could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But  remember  how  you  went  eighty-seven  days  without  fish  and  then  we  caught  big  ones
every day for three weeks.”
“I remember,” the old man said. “I know
you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I
am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
‘Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer
on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fisherme
n made fun of the old man and he was not
angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at hi
m and were sad. But they did not show it and they
spoke  politely  about  the  current  and  the  depths  they  had  drifted  their  lines  at  and  the  steady  good
weather  and  of  what  they  had  seen.  The  successful
  fishermen  of  that  day  were  already  in  and  had
butchered  their  marlin  out  and  carried  them  laid  full  length  across  two  planks,  with  two  men

staggering  at  the  end  of  each  plank,  to  the  fish  house  where  they  waited  for  the  ice  truck  to  carry
them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught
 sharks had taken them to the shark factory on
the other side of the cove where they were hoisted
 on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When  the  wind  was  in  the  east  a  smell  came  ac
ross  the  harbour  from  the  shark  factory;  but
today  there  [11]  was  only  the  faint  edge  of  the  od
our  because  the  wind  had  backed  into  the  north
and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding hi
s glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five  and  you  nearly  were  killed  when  I  brought
the  fish  in  too  green  and  he  nearly  tore  the
boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I  can  remember  the  tail  slapping  and  banging
and  the  thwart  breaking  and  the  noise  of  the
clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into th
e bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling
the whole boat shiver and the noise of you club
bing him like chopping a
tree  down  and  the  sweet
blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”
“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,”
he said. “But you are your father’s and your
mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,”  the  old  man  said.  His  hope  and  his  confidence  had  never  gone.  But  now  they  were
freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank  you,”  the  old  man  said.  He  was  too  simple  to  wonder  when  he  had  attained  humility.
But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it
 was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true
pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy
said. “Then if you hook something truly big we can
come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something th
at he cannot see such as a bird working and get
him to come out after dolphin.”
“Are his eyes that bad?”
“He is almost blind.”
“It is strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.”
“But you went turtle-ing for years off th
e Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”

“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14]  “Let  us  take  the  stuff  home,”  the  boy  said.
“So  I  can  get  the  cast  net  and  go  after  the
sardines.”
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the
boy  carried  the  wooden  boat  with
  the  coiled,  hard-braided  brown  lines,  the  gaff  and  the  harpoon
with its shaft. The box with the baits was under th
e stern of the skiff along with the club that was
used  to  subdue  the  big  fish  when  they  were  brought  alongside.  No  one  would  steal  from  the  old
man  but  it  was  better  to  take  the  sail  and  the  he
avy  lines  home  as  the  dew  was  bad  for  them  and,
though he was quite sure no local people would steal
from him, the old man thought that a gaff and
a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They  walked  up  the  road  together  to  the  old
man’s  shack  and  went  in  through  its  open  door.
The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail
 against the wall and the boy put the box and the
other gear beside it. The
mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made
of the tough budshields of the ro
yal palm which are called guano and
in it there was a bed, a table,
one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook wi
th charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened,
overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a pictu
re in color of the Sacred Heart
of  Jesus  and  another  of  the  Virgin  of  Cobre.  Thes
e  were  relics  of  his  wife.  Once  there  had  been  a
tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had
taken it down because it made him too lonely
to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on.
Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered
when they had sold it. But they went through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of ye
llow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.
“Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man sa
id. “How would you like to see me bring one in
that dressed out over a thousand pounds?”
“I’ll get the cast net and go for sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s pape
r and I will read the baseball.”
The boy did not know whether yesterday’s paper wa
s a fiction too. But the old man brought it
out from under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explaine
d. “I’ll be back when I have the sardines. I’ll
keep yours and mine together on
ice and we can share them in the morning. When I come back you
can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”
“Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio.”
“I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.”
“Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sax of Chicago.”
“You study it and tell me when I come back.”
“Do  you  think  we  should  buy  a  terminal  of  the  lottery  with  an  eighty-five?  Tomorrow  is  the
eighty-fifth day.”
“We can do that,” the boy said. “But what a
bout the eighty-seven of your great record?”
[17] “It could not happen twice. Do you
think you can find an eighty-five?”

“I can order one.
“One sheet. That’s two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?”
“That’s easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half.”
“I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.”
“Keep warm old man,” the boy said. “Remember we are in September.”
“The  month  when  the  great  fish  come,”  the  old  man  said.  “Anyone  can  be  a  fisherman  in
May.”
“I go now for the sardines,” the boy said.
When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy
took  the  old  army  blanket  off  the  bed  and  spread  it  over  the  back  of  the  chair  and  over  the  old
man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still
powerful although very old, and the neck was still
strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen
forward.  His  shirt  had  been  patched  so  many  ti
mes  that  it  was  like  the  sail  and  the  patches  were
faded to many different shades by the sun. The [18] old man’s head was very old though and with
his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The n
ewspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his
arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted.
The boy left him there and when he ca
me back the old man was still asleep.
“Wake up old man,” the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man’s knees.
The  old  man  opened  his  eyes  and  for  a  moment  he  was  coming  back  from  a  long  way  away.
Then he smiled.
“What have you got?” he asked.
“Supper,” said the boy. “We’
re going to have supper.”
“I’m not very hungry.”
“Come on and eat. You can’t fish and not eat.”
“I have,” the old man said getting up and taking
 the newspaper and folding it. Then he started
to fold the blanket.
“Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You
’ll not fish without eating while I’m alive.”
“Then live a long time and take care of your
self,” the old man said. “What are we eating?”
“Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.”
[19] The boy had brought them in a two-decker
metal container from the Terrace. The two sets
of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket
with a paper napkin wrapped around each set.
“Who gave this to you?”
“Martin. The owner.”
“I must thank him.”
“I thanked him already,” the boy said. “You don’t need to thank him.”
“I’ll give him the belly meat of a big fish,” the
old man said. “Has he done this for us more than
once?”
“I think so.”
“I must give him something more than the belly
 meat then. He is very thoughtful for us.”
“He sent two beers.”
“I like the beer in cans best.”
“I know. But this is in bottles, Hatu
ey beer, and I take back the bottles.”
“That’s very kind of you,” the old man said. “Should we eat?”
“I’ve  been  asking  you  to,”  the  boy  told  him  ge
ntly.  “I  have  not  wished  to  open  the  container
until you were ready.”
[20] “I’m ready now,” the old man said. “I only needed time to wash.”
Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets down the road.
I  must  have  water  here  for  him,  the  boy  thou
ght,  and  soap  and  a  good  towel.  Why  am  I  so

thoughtless?  I  must  get  him  another  shirt  and  a  jacket  for  the  winter  and  some  sort  of  shoes  and
another blanket.
“Your stew is excellent,” the old man said.
“Tell me about the baseball,” the boy asked him.
“In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,” the old man said happily.”
“They lost today,” the boy told him.
“That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.”
“They have other men on the team.”
“Naturally.   But   he   makes   the   difference.   In   the   other   league,   between   Brooklyn   and
Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think
of Dick Sisler and those great drives In the old
park.”
“There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.”
“Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace?”
[21] “I wanted to take him fishing but I was t
oo timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him
and you were too timid.”
“I know. It was a great mistake. He might have
gone with us. Then we would have that for all
of our lives.”
“I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,” the old man said. “They say his father was a
fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand.”
“The  great  Sisler’s  father  was  never  poor  and  he
,  the  father,  was  playing  in  the  Big  Leagues
when he was my age.”
“When  I  was  your  age  I  was  befo
re  the  mast  on  a  square  rigged  sh
ip  that  ran  to  Africa  and  I
have seen lions on the beaches in the evening.”
“I know. You told me.”
“Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?”
“Baseball I think,” the boy said. “Tell me about the great John J. McGraw.” He said Jota for J.
“He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in
 the older days. But he was rough and harsh-
spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mi
nd was on horses as well as baseball. At least he
carried lists of [22] horses at all times in his poc
ket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the
telephone.”
“He was a great manager,” the boy said. “My father thinks he was the greatest.”
“Because he came here the most times,” the old man said. “If Durocher had continued to come
here each year your father woul
d think him the greatest manager.”
“Who is the greatest manager, rea
lly, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?”
“I think they are equal.”
“And the best fisherman is you.”
“No. I know others better.”
“Que  Va,”  the  boy  said.  “There  are  many  good  fishermen  and  some  great  ones.  But  there  is
only you.”
“Thank you. You make me happy.
 I hope no fish will come along so
 great that he will prove us
wrong.”
“There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.”
“I  may  not  be  as  strong  as  I  think,”  the  old
man  said.  “But  I  know  many  tricks  and  I  have
resolution.”
“You  ought  to  go  to  bed  now  so  that  you  will  be
  fresh  in  the  morning.  I  will  take  the  things
back to the Terrace.”
[23] “Good night then. I will wake you in the morning.”
“You’re my alarm clock,” the boy said.
